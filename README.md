## UI for extended logs collector 

**A few words to begin with**

This UI is the front-end for a tool described [here](https://github.com/panovitcin/extended_logs_collector).

**About the project**

This is a browser extension written in plain JavaScript. It uses the Chrome API to interact with browser events and resources. To make it stylish, I used the Bulma CSS framework.
